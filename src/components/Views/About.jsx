        <h3 className="text-xl md:text-2xl text-gray-700 my-10">At Docent Disciple Dream Technologies, our journey began with a mission to provide top-notch training for individuals in the US from our base in India.

        <h3 className="text-xl md:text-2xl text-gray-700 my-10">However, as we encountered challenges with time zone differences, we realized the need for a more localized approach to serve our audience effectively.
            With this vision in mind, we made the strategic decision to pivot and establish our Education-tech company in India. 
            This move allows us to leverage our expertise and resources to cater to the unique needs of learners within our own time zone, ensuring seamless access to world-class education and training opportunities.
